## Introduction

This repository serves as my way to help me setup and maintain my Mac. It takes the effort out of installing everything manually. Everything needed to install my preferred setup of macOS is detailed in this readme. Feel free to explore, learn and copy parts for your own dotfiles. Enjoy!

## A Fresh macOS Setup

These instructions are for setting up new Mac devices. Instead, if you want to get started building your own dotfiles, you can [find those instructions below](#your-own-dotfiles).

### Setting up your Mac

1. Update macOS to the latest version through system preferences
2. Clone this repo to `~/.dotfiles` with:

    ```zsh
    git clone --recursive https://github.com/jeffdesc/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles
    ```

3. Run the installation with:

    ```zsh
    cd ~/.dotfiles && ./install_mac.sh
    ```

4. Restart your computer to finalize the process

Your Mac is now ready to use!

> ðŸ’¡ You can use a different location than `~/.dotfiles` if you want. Make sure you also update the reference in the [`.zshrc`](./.zshrc#L2) file.

## Thanks To...

I first got the idea for starting this project by visiting the [GitHub does dotfiles](https://dotfiles.github.io/) project. Both [Zach Holman](https://github.com/holman/dotfiles) and [Mathias Bynens](https://github.com/mathiasbynens/dotfiles) were great sources of inspiration. [Sourabh Bajaj](https://twitter.com/sb2nov/)'s [Mac OS X Setup Guide](http://sourabhbajaj.com/mac-setup/) proved to be invaluable. Thanks to [@subnixr](https://github.com/subnixr) for [his awesome Zsh theme](https://github.com/subnixr/minimal)! Thanks to [Caneco](https://twitter.com/caneco) for the header in this readme. And lastly, I'd like to thank [Emma Fabre](https://twitter.com/anahkiasen) for [her excellent presentation on Homebrew](https://speakerdeck.com/anahkiasen/a-storm-homebrewin) which made me migrate a lot to a [`Brewfile`](./Brewfile) and [Mackup](https://github.com/lra/mackup).

In general, I'd like to thank every single one who open-sources their dotfiles for their effort to contribute something to the open-source community.
